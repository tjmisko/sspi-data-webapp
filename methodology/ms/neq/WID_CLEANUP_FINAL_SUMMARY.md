# WID Dataset Cleanup - Final Summary

**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Branch:** 716-clean-wid-datasets-for-pre-and-post-tax-comparisons  
**Objective:** Systematically evaluate and clean WID datasets for pre- and post-tax comparisons

## Overview

Successfully reduced WID dataset count from **359 to 65** (82% reduction) through systematic evaluation and cleanup of empty and low-quality datasets.

## Cleanup Phases

### Phase 1: Empty Dataset Removal
- **Evaluated:** 359 WID datasets in sspi_clean_api_data
- **Found:** 209 datasets with data, 150 empty datasets
- **Removed:** 322 files/directories (150 Python files + 150 docs + 22 orphaned)
- **Script:** `scripts/evaluate_wid_datasets.py`
- **Summary:** `wid_empty_cleanup_summary.txt`

### Phase 2: Country Coverage Analysis
- **Analyzed:** Country coverage for 209 remaining datasets
- **Reference:** SSPI67 country group (66 countries)
- **Coverage Categories:**
  - Excellent: 90%+ (40 datasets)
  - Good: 68-89% (25 datasets)
  - Fair: 30-67% (0 datasets)
  - Poor: 15-29% (5 datasets)
  - Very Poor: <15% (139 datasets)
- **Script:** `scripts/analyze_wid_country_coverage.py`
- **Report:** `wid_country_coverage_report.csv`

### Phase 3: Low Coverage Cleanup
- **Threshold:** User specified 68%+ for "good or excellent" coverage
- **Removed:** 144 datasets with <68% coverage (288 files total)
- **Kept:** 65 high-quality datasets with strong global coverage
- **Script:** `scripts/cleanup_low_coverage_datasets.py`
- **Summary:** `wid_low_coverage_cleanup_summary.txt`

### Phase 4: Directory Synchronization
- **Issue:** Found 101 documentation directories vs 65 Python files
- **Identified:** 36 orphaned documentation directories (NACCAV: 24, TRANSFERAV: 12)
- **Cleaned:** Removed all 36 orphaned directories
- **Verification:** Directories now perfectly synchronized (65 each)
- **Scripts:** `scripts/find_orphaned_wid_docs.py`, manual cleanup

## Final Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| **Total Datasets** | 359 | 65 | -294 (-82%) |
| **Python Files** | 359 | 65 | -294 (-82%) |
| **Documentation Dirs** | 359 | 65 | -294 (-82%) |
| **Directory Sync** | No | Yes | ✓ |

## Remaining Dataset Quality

### Coverage Distribution (65 datasets)
- **Excellent (90%+):** 40 datasets (61.5%)
- **Good (68-89%):** 25 datasets (38.5%)
- **Average Coverage:** 87.8%

### Family Distribution
- **BENEFITAV:** 14 datasets (avg 79.4% coverage)
- **NACCAV:** 4 datasets (avg 74.2% coverage)
- **NINCAV:** 11 datasets (avg 88.1% coverage, high-quality subset)
- **NINCBRK:** 5 datasets (avg 88.0% coverage, high-quality subset)
- **NINCRAT:** 2 datasets (avg 100% coverage)
- **NINCSH:** 8 datasets (avg 88.1% coverage, high-quality subset)
- **NINCTH:** 6 datasets (avg 89.9% coverage, high-quality subset)
- **TAXAV:** 7 datasets (avg 78.4% coverage)
- **WEALTHAV:** 4 datasets (avg 85.6% coverage, high-quality subset)
- **WEALTHBRK:** 3 datasets (avg 99.5% coverage)
- **WEALTHRAT:** 1 dataset (100% coverage)
- **WEALTHSH:** 3 datasets (avg 88.1% coverage, high-quality subset)
- **WEALTHTH:** 3 datasets (avg 100% coverage)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Scripts Created
1. **evaluate_wid_datasets.py** - Database queries to identify empty datasets
2. **cleanup_empty_wid_datasets.py** - Remove empty datasets and orphaned files
3. **analyze_wid_country_coverage.py** - Comprehensive coverage analysis
4. **cleanup_low_coverage_datasets.py** - Remove datasets below quality threshold
5. **find_orphaned_wid_docs.py** - Identify directory synchronization issues
6. **cleanup_orphaned_wid_docs.py** - Clean orphaned documentation

### Error Handling & Fixes
- **CSV Field Mismatch:** Fixed fieldnames in coverage analysis
- **String Format Error:** Fixed CountryCount casting in cleanup script
- **Interactive Input:** Used direct bash commands for final cleanup

## Files Generated
- `wid_datasets_status.csv` - Initial dataset evaluation results
- `wid_country_coverage_report.csv` - Detailed coverage analysis
- `wid_coverage_by_category.csv` - Coverage summary by family/percentile
- `wid_low_coverage_candidates.csv` - Datasets marked for removal
- `wid_orphaned_docs.txt` - List of orphaned documentation directories
- Various summary files documenting each cleanup phase

## Data Quality Achieved

The remaining 65 WID datasets represent a high-quality, globally representative subset suitable for robust pre- and post-tax inequality comparisons:

- **Global Coverage:** All datasets have ≥68% country coverage
- **Data Integrity:** All datasets contain actual observations
- **Directory Sync:** Perfect alignment between Python cleaners and documentation
- **Research Ready:** Strong foundation for comparative analysis

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify dataset count
ls sspi_flask_app/api/core/datasets/wid_*.py | wc -l  # Should be 65
ls datasets/wid_* | wc -l  # Should be 65

# Verify directory sync
python scripts/find_orphaned_wid_docs.py  # Should show 0 orphaned

# Check git status
git status  # Review all changes before commit
```

## Next Steps

1. Review final dataset selection
2. Test data collection/cleaning pipeline with remaining datasets
3. Commit changes when satisfied with results
4. Update any dependent documentation or configurations
