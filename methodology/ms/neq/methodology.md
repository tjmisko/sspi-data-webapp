Category: Inequality
CategoryCode: NEQ
Description: The inequality category in the SSPI evaluates national policies designed to promote income redistribution and shared prosperity; it is measured mainly through the income share of the bottom 50% relative to the top 10% and the post-tax-and-transfer Gini coefficient. The report finds that scores for the inequality category are among the lowest across all market structure measures, highlighting a widespread need for stronger redistributive policies to ensure basic economic security and reduce disparities globally
ShortDescription: Policies promoting an equitable and mobile society
IndicatorCodes:
  - ISHRAT
  - GINIPT
Pillar: Market Structure

# Inequality
## First Impressions of the Category (a bullet point list of ideas of policies, a sentence or two each):
### What policies would the best governments be implementing to support well-being or sustainability in relation to this category?

- Governments should have progressive taxation systems allowing for strong fiscal redistribution programs, including public spending and strong welfare systems and basic income interventions (ie social safety nets)
- This overlaps with financial sector, but preventing monopolies and oligarchies allows for more equal distribution of money in the economy and competition which also should drive equality
- Governmental vs private control of money and resources in an economy should also be considered in the vein of corruption and bribes. Countries with too strong a government or too powerful bureaucrats drive inequality as the common people are often excluded from wealth. Thus, standardized pay-scales that are comparable to the private sector would be a good policy.
- Capital gains taxes may or may not be correlated with higher or lower levels of inequality

### If we weren’t constrained by data, what would we measure in this category to assess policies across countries?
- More in-depth inequality data in terms of usage patterns, transaction frequency, savings, and credit access among different groups—more than just one general measure
- Capital flow analysis and participation of different groups in the economy and its various sectors
- Level and effectiveness of specific inequality-based policies like welfare systems, taxations systems (ie progressive vs regressive, tax brackets)

## Literature Review (review at least 1-2 sources per category, record links/informal citations so we can find them and outline how they fit together → this is an ongoing assignment):
### Sources: 
- From Ambition to Execution: Policies in Support of Sustainable Development Goals
- PROTOCOL: Effects of guaranteed basic income interventions on poverty‐related outcomes in high‐income countries: A systematic review - PMC
- Benefits of a Financial Transaction Tax

### What policies do countries actually pursue, and what are their successes, limitations, failures and/or unintended consequences?

- Countries currently have a mix of welfare systems—including means-tested, UBI, and more—which can be generally categorized into simpler vs more complex ones which target specific groups in the economy. They also have different tax systems, with different ways of calculating income tax, sales tax, and capital gains tax.
- Successes include lowering poverty rates, increasing the size of the middle class, and strong social safety nets
- Failures include excessive taxation leading to reduced domestic investment & entrepreneurship as brain drain occurs, as well as causing inflation, wasteful spending, and locking people into low paying jobs

### What are the scholarly debates? What is the general consensus and what are the fringe ideas?

- General Consensus
- Inter-personal distribution of income, gender inequality (opportunities for women to participate in remunerated econ activities), access to financial services important
- Low tax-to-GDP ratios are common in developing countries with large informal sectors, which limits income redistribution (which is mainly controlled by fiscal policy)
- Reliance on indirect taxes which are generally regressive hurt economies
- Gender gaps declining but still exist
- Outsourcing of manufacturing by developed countries combined with technological advancement is causing divergent trends between higher-income & lower-income countries
- Non-financial metrics for poverty outside of income include
- Homelessness / issues with housing
- Addiction
- Abusive Relationships
- Mental Illness
- Hunger & food insecurity
- Linear relationship between severity of food insecurity & odds of experiencing other types of hardships
- So don’t need to measure all of them, maybe just one
- Debates
- Welfare programs have been shown to reduce poverty significantly—especially in the post war period—yet are now blamed for causing laziness and poverty themselves (ie by forcing low paying jobs within the min income threshold)

### What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?

- Can look at Female Labor Force Participation Rates, % of female in positions of power, % women led businesses, % of women in government
- Could look at makeup of regressive to progressive taxes
- Proportion of middle class
- Cost of social assistance programs (measured by OECD)
- Measuring poverty
- Regular measures
- Consumption based measures
- Income found to have low correlation w/ severe material deprivation
- Official Poverty Measure (OPM) in US
- UNDP, IFAD, and UNICEF have all developed multidimensional poverty measures
- Outcomes measured by the Cambell Systematic Review study
- Primary
- Food security level (using survey‐based, validated measures, as described above)
- Poverty level assessed using instruments intended or designed to measure poverty: income‐based official poverty measures, and alternative/novel measures based on material hardship/deprivation, the consumption level of goods and services, as well as multi‐dimensional - measures of physical, social and/or psychological wellbeing
- Secondary
- Food expenditure
- Self‐reported physical and mental health
- Body mass index (BMI)
- BMI for age
- Mid‐upper arm circumference (MUAC)
- Birth weight of children
- Cognitive development, literacy, and numeracy of children
- School/training program enrollment (children and adults)
- Employment/self‐employment status/labor force participation
- Individual/household earnings
- Percentage of total stocks owned by the top 10% of households

## Looking at the SSPI:
### How does the SSPI attempt to measure the policies in this category, and what are its shortcomings and strengths?
- The SSPI has a very simply and barebones way to measure policies in this category, primary just looking at the GINI coefficient as a general measure of wealth inequality
- Strengths
- Uses a well accepted and defined measure to track overall inequality that can holistically encompass a wide range of factors
- Shortcomings
- Relies on income-based measurements rather than consumption based ones (ie if you make more money but you have to spend disproportionately more on health care, you are really poorer)
- Fails to really target policies and instead focuses on general holistic measurements like the Gini coefficient

### Based on your lit review, what policies seem measurable that we aren’t currently measuring?
- Anti-trust laws, presence of monopolies in an economy
- Labor force participation for disadvantaged ethnicities, genders, and other groups	
- Progressiveness of tax system, level of taxation, strength of taxation systems
- Welfare systems and social safety nets (measured through consumption based measures)
