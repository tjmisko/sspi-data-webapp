# Financial Sector
## First Impressions of the Category (a bullet point list of ideas of policies, a sentence or two each):
### What policies would the best governments be implementing to support well-being or sustainability in relation to this category?
- The government should be supporting small business growth & entrepreneurship through small business loans, low regulatory barriers to entry, and tax credits. They should also have strong anti-trust laws in place to prevent monopolies and oligarchies   
- In the same vein, the government should have strong banking regulation to prevent abuse of the financial sector as well as strong reporting requirements.
- Potentially there should exist some laws to allow for liquid markets
- Education systems should have high levels of financial literacy.


### If we weren’t constrained by data, what would we measure in this category to assess policies across countries?
- % of small businesses receiving government-backed loans or guarantees
- Average loan approval time for SMEs
- Tax credits or subsidies as % of SME GDP contribution
- Average cost (time + fees) to start a business
- Behavioral metrics: % of citizens with emergency savings
- Composite index of bank capital adequacy, leverage limits, and liquidity ratios
- Share of bank assets covered by regulation (vs. shadow finance)
- % of financial institutions undergoing annual independent audits
- Frequency and severity of financial misconduct cases
- Timeliness and accuracy of public financial data
- Market concentration ratios in major financial subsectors (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
- Average time from investigation to resolution for antitrust cases

## Literature Review (review at least 1-2 sources per category, record links/informal citations so we can find them and outline how they fit together → this is an ongoing assignment):
### Sources: 
- From Ambition to Execution: Policies in Support of Sustainable Development Goals
- How financial authorities can build a sustainable financial system | Policy report | PRI

### What policies do countries actually pursue, and what are their successes, limitations, failures and/or unintended consequences?
- Countries sometimes pursue currency manipulation to drive exports and improve their economy, but this can lead to high import costs that hurt poorer citizens who depend on imported foods
- Countries can choose to nationalize industries which can lead to a lack of competition and inefficiencies, or privatize and cause inequality & corruption

### What are the scholarly debates? What is the general consensus and what are the fringe ideas?
- General Consensus
- Macroeconomics & financial stability necessary, but not sufficient
- For dev countries, economic diversification & structural transformation critical
- High correlation between these and income per capita
- Most important policies:
- Infrastructure & its efficiency
- Enhance human capital
- Support Financial deepening
- Boost agricultural productivity
- Reduction in trade barriers, integration through participation in regional trade agreements, better infrastructure & human capital formation helped
- Raising public investment has significant long term benefits fro growth
- Most important thing is increasing efficiency of infrastructure (ie: strengthening public investment management through transparency of budget execution, openness of procurement process, efficiency of cash management)
- Access to deeper financial markets important
- Access to finance a key constraint
- Low & stable inflation environment helps most vulnerable
- Large exchange rate movements have mixed impact
- What governments can do
- Create enabling environment for responsible investors
- Respond to emerging, sustainability related government goals

### What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?

- Export Diversification (Inverse Theil Index)
- Could look at tariff policies, (net) exports as % of gdp, general integration into global economy
- Could look at productivity of capital, levels of public vs private investment
- Transaction costs per customer and volumes of transactions 
- Inflation rates
- Exchange rate movements, value of currency
- Could look at transparency in the financial system
- Could look at investor protection
- Financial Sector Policy Activity Indices (FSPAI)

## Looking at the SSPI:
### How does the SSPI attempt to measure the policies in this category, and what are its shortcomings and strengths?

- The SSPI looks primarily at banking related metrics, and provides a simple yet comprehensive way to approach this issue
- It measures the size of the financial system, how many people own a bank account, and the default rate in a society
- The SSPI fails to look at numerous other factors, however, that are more economic in nature yet are extremely important policy choices that countries choose to make

### Based on your lit review, what policies seem measurable that we aren’t currently measuring?

- Tariffs, Exports, Exchange Rates, Integration in Global Economy
- Investor Protection, Financial Reporting Standards, Transparency
- Inflation Rates
- Productivity of Capital
