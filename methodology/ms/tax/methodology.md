**Review of current indicators:**
Between the corporate tax rate and tax revenue indicators, I think this category is beginning to paint a holistic picture of who tax policy affects.
Want to see more of the “how” in addition to “who.” Apart from corporate taxation, how are the individual taxes people pay used for different government functions (e.g. payroll taxes for social services, income taxes for separate general fund)? 
Would serve as another measurement of “Role of Public Sector” in a similar way to tax revenue, but would provide more fine-grained insight into what functionalities the government uses these taxes for.

**Potential new indicators ideation:** 
Progressivity of tax system: arithmetic methodology could be the ratio of the amount taxed in the highest tax bracket to the lowest. Consider also countries collecting no personal income tax.
Tax incentives: these are government tools wielded to selectively lower person/business tax liability to encourage activities that benefit the economy or promote social good. Monitoring what sectors incentives crop up in, and how much tax relief is given could be an interesting indicator to interpret.

**State of the literature:**
1. Tax Policy for Emerging Markets: Developing Countries (2000, Tanzi & Zee)
  - https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41789458.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3Ac6813901f7faa4125f47dc15f3b3e50c&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&initiator=&acceptTC=1	
  - Argues that developing countries face institutional taxation challenges, such as an overreliance on trade or consumption taxes (taxes on purchase of goods/services, paid directly by consumers)
2. From Optimal Tax Theory to Applied Tax Policy (2013, Jacobs)
  - https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/43297182.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3Ac487d778b25f00ed8d1362509da7bbed&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&initiator=&acceptTC=1	
  - Aims to provide a perspective on an ideal tax system following optimal tax theory (study of designing a tax that maximises social welfare under realistic economic constraints)
  - Argues for progressive taxation (nonlinear labor-income taxes) and taxing capital income (income earned from owning wealth such as interest, property, etc.). 
  - Discusses the “excess burden of taxation,” which is the economic inefficiency that results from a tax, AKA the idea that raising $1 in taxes costs society more than $1. 
    - Should this be incorporated into an indicator? Perhaps just something to keep in mind while working through all indicators?
  - Quantitative Methodology: uses simulation models to estimate how changes in tax rates affect peoples’ behavior and collective welfare. Uses a social welfare function that sums the utility of an individual weighted by how valuable it would be to provide welfare to that individual over all individuals (weights vary across income groups). This is a measure of aggregated societal welfare.
