## Issues
- "The Country Score depends on the amount of information that is sent to the Convention's Secretariat"
- Currently, we're looking at evaluations of reporting procedure. It is good that we are looking directly at policy, but there is uncertainty about implementation.
- EPI has several series that track ozone, lead exposure, and others that look at it from the outcome side, evaluating exposure by "the number of age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years lost per 100,000 due to lead exposure," for example
