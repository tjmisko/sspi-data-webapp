Description: An index measuring the sustainability of Nitrogen management based on
  Nitrogen use efficiency (in agriculture) and land use efficiency (crop yield). The
  Sustainable Nitrogen Management Index (SNMI) seeks to balance the efficient application
  of nitrogen fertilizer with maximum crop yields as a measure of the environmental
  performance of agricultural production. The 2022 EPI uses the SNMI as a proxy for
  agricultural drivers of environmental damage.
