Description: "Average of the following two metrics: \n1. Change in Water Use Efficiency\
  \ (WUE), 2018 compared with 2010-2015 average: WUE is the value added of a given\
  \ major sector divided by the volume of water used. WUE at the national level is\
  \ the sum of the efficiencies in the major economic sectors weighted according to\
  \ the proportion of water withdrawn by each sector over the total withdrawals \n\
  2. Level of Water Stress: Freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater\
  \ resources is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawal by major economic sectors\
  \ and total renewable \nfreshwater resources, after taking into account environmental\
  \ water requirements. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity."
