**Review of current indicators:** 
  - Curious how the nitrogen management indicator incorporates land use efficiency–is it just the amount of nitrogen used over crops yielded?
  - The carbon sequestration indicator is currently only calculated over forest land. Why aren’t we considering other types of land? 
  - I agree with the splitting of different GHGs—carbon and nitrogen—into different indicators, since their climate impacts differ and thus complicate policy choices.

**Potential new indicators ideation:** 
  - Land use efficiency, revisited: considering agricultural land’s dual capacity to minimize emissions and maximize carbon storage, can be thought of as the “carbon opportunity cost.” Quantified by percentage change of ag land, would require a breakdown of all land types. Have previously explored this via USDA reports, but of course, the specific categories are specific to the U.S..
  - How productive the land is, calories churned out? Though upon further reflection, this could be an unnecessary replica of land use efficiency. 
    - “The agriculture sector in the United States is highly productive, turning out about 3,600 calories per person per day, far more than the approximately 2,300 per day needed. In addition, U.S. agriculture produces over 4,000,000 metric tons of cotton and 16 billion gallons of biofuel each year.” (Farming for Our Future)
  - Global fertilizer use? Perhaps percent change in irrigated cropland?

**State of the literature:**
1. Farming for our Future (2021, Lehner & Rosenberg)
  - I did not finish reading this entire book, but I thought it made an incredibly salient point in asking us to consider the very emissions bringing up the point that agencies such as the EPA undercount the ag sector’s actual emissions, insofar as it does not consider the lost opportunity of ag land to sequester more carbon. It also systematically excludes on-farm energy and annual land use conversion from its estimates.
    - If anything, this serves as a reminder to always approach the data we’re working with with a healthy dose of caution and a critical eye. How is the data made, how are these categories created?
    - “EPA includes on-farm fuel combustion such as for tractors or direct heating in the industrial sector; on-farm electricity for irrigation pumps, cooling, heating, ventilation, and other needs in the electricity sector; and soil carbon lost from conversion of forest or other nonagricultural land to farmland in the consideration of land use. Thus, these emissions are not included in EPA’s calculations for the “agriculture” sector. Nor does EPA’s agricultural tally include emissions related to aquaculture and fisheries, which provide significant amounts of our food” (p. 52)
