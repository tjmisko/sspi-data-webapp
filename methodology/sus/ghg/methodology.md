# First Impressions of the Category 
* **Sources of Energy** (overlap): Methods of generating energy have drastically different levels of GHG emission. For example, burning fossil fuels generate significantly more CO2 than other methods like wind, solar and geothermal. 
* **Transportation - Non-car transportation usage**: To reduce reliance on individual high-emission vehicles, the governemnt should encourage cycling, walking and the use of public transportation instead. 
    * Data on accessibility/usage of the above transportation means 
* **Transportation - EV usage**: Most cars are heavily-reliant on cars as a means of transportation. For those countries, using EVs rather than fuel-powered cars would reduce GHGs emitted from the car. 
    * Government subsidies for purchasing EVs or the cost of building EV charging machines 
    * Government taxation on the cost of fuel, or fuel-powered vehicles 
* **Deforestation** (overlap) : More CO2 in the atmosphere without as much greenery to absorb it. 
* **Agricutlural Production**: Agriculture produces a large amount of GHGs through manure management, enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide from fertilizers, tilling, and soil management. 
    * Agricultural emissions based on agriculture output  
* **Economic Incentives**: Caps and taxation on emissions, to incentiveses reduction by businesses. 
    * Existence and extent of carbon taxes, cap-and-trade system and more 

# Thoughts & Questions
* On the topic of weightage, it must be easier to prioritise and rank categories of GHG, given that there is clear emissions data. Some countries prioritise categories which emit a higher amount and that should be considered when comparing across countries  
* Being careful not to overlap with the energy section (because the bulk of GHG is caused by energy production), what is the distinction between the GHG category and the other sustainability categories? 
* Different countries adopt different policies based on their national context (e.g., some countries just can't harvest natural energy) so would it make more sense just to look at overall carbon emissions? 
* Would PM2.5 and PM10 be an accurate measurement? They are pollutants more than GHGs. Is this category meant to be understanding GHGs which speed up global warming? 
* Seems messy that some indicators directly measure pollution while others measure consumption, and others measure policies like fuel prices.

## Pursued Policies - successes, limitations, failures and unintended consequences
Policies can be categorised based on the industry or area they focus on, which can have many overlaps: 
* Energy 
* Agriculture 
* Industrial 
* Residential 
* Broad-based policies

Policies can also be categorised into the mechanisms: 
* Market-based approaches (possible economic disruptions and distributional inequalities) 
* Regulatory policies (e.g., emissions or energy standards)
* Investment into research 
* Subsidies for adoption of green technology 
* Information policies (e.g., labeling, education campaigns)

## Academic Debates 
There is broad consensus that climate change is real and increasing GHG emissions are detrimental. It is also a massive market failure, which causes the exacerbation of the issue. One key example of this is how everyone suffers similar repercussions although the largest polluters are China, the US, India, Russia and the EU; most other countries produce a significatly smaller amount of GHGs. There are still questions on:
* The speed in which climate change will happen (and some climate skeptics)
* Which countries should be responsible for reducing emissions (e.g., historical data, current production or growth rate of the country)
* How much to rely on untested technology in the solutions 
* Balancing between adapting to higher emissions or preventing it 
* Which policy approach is the best  

## Data 
What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?

A global one-of-its-kind framework to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and actions in reducing GHGs is the Policy and Action Standard by the World Resources Institute. it operates by evaluating a singple specific policy or a small group of policies. This process is done by identifying the sources/sinks for GHGs and estimating policy scenarios for each one of them. Together with a baseline emission, the estimated emission level will be found. Afterwards, there is an assessment of uncertainty and performance, based on established key performance indicators. 

Usage of the Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development (EISD) (IAEA, 2005). This measured 30 indicators in three dimensions of Social, Economic and Environmental. This is a reliable and well-used framework which includes indicators like GHG per capita and Carbon Intensity of GDP.
