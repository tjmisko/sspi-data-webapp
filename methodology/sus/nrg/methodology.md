# Energy
## First Impressions of the Category (a bullet point list of ideas of policies, a sentence or two each):
### What policies would the best governments be implementing to support well-being or sustainability in relation to this category?
- Immediate First Impressions: Green energy/sustainable energy(maybe nuclear energy as it becomes more viable in the future, if it’s possible some way to check flexibility of switching energy sources potentially)
- Subsidizing green/sustainable energy companies, subsidizing green energy products like EVs
- Carbon taxes on companies with product/services that produce emissions, incentivize switching to cleaner energy sources
- Improving Energy efficiency
- Ensuring access to clean energy
- Phasing out fossil fuel reliance responsibly
- Encouraging cyclic (recylable) and sustainable energy systems
- promoting global cooperation to achieve these goals (i.e. Geneva Convention)

### If we weren’t constrained by data, what would we measure in this category to assess policies across countries?
- Equitable Accessible Distribution: While the goal is 100% distribution rate for countries to have 24/7 reliable energy access, we would measure energy access over time, with the goal above.
- Quality of energy supplied: Could be measured through power outage frequency/household, or if provided by private sector, through that firms level of reliabbility
- Affordability: -what percentage of household income goes towards energy bills
- Energy Equity: measuring gaps in energy distribution across communities based on income and place of residence(district).
- Off grid access: integrating energy measurement to off grid communities

## Literature Review (review at least 1-2 sources per category, record links/informal citations so we can find them and outline how they fit together → this is an ongoing assignment):
### Sources:
1. Romp, W. & de Haan, J. (2007). “Public capital and economic growth: A critical survey.” Perspectives on European Economic Integration.\
2. “Energy Transition and the Economy: A Review Article” — Talat S. Genc & Stephen Kosempel (2023)

### What policies do countries actually pursue, and what are their successes, limitations, failures and/or unintended consequences?
- Renewable support: feed-in tariffs, auctions, tax credits, mandates/renewable portfolio standards.
  - Lower prices/offer money back to incentivize innovation(supported by investment)/usage of sustainable energy sources

- Market/regulatory tools: carbon pricing (ETS, carbon tax), phaseouts of fossil fuel subsidies, efficiency standards.
  - Similar to above/”money back/discount” is a massively used policy incentive to achieve desired outcomes. Efficiency standards imposed a universal minimum level that companies must meet.

### What are the scholarly debates? What is the general consensus and what are the fringe ideas?
- How fast should decarbnization happen?
- Consensus: We need to be vigilant within the next decade to achieve net zero emissions by 2050
- Fringe: Achieving Net Zero must be done by 2030, to achieve heavily challenges current infrastructure growth by completely phasing out emissions based energy consumption
- Green energy should be equitable, how should it be done?
- Consensus: Process must be done right so that marginalzied communities aren't harmed by price hikes for energy infrastructure switch.
- Fringe: Energy should be decentralized, should be considered a basic human right regardless of income and provided at minimal cost.
- What role does Technology play in transitioning to green energy?
- Consensus: A good thing, smart grids, atteries, and hydrogen as an energy source are key enablers behind positive perception. AI, IOT, and digitization reduces waste.
- Fringe: Necessity to move to most promising energy sources(nuclear fusion) based on waste production as soon as possible.

### What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?
- electricity generation by source (grid data)
- emissions inventories
- firm-level investment data
- household surveys on energy spending prices
- high-frequency grid dispatch/market data

## Looking at the SSPI:
### How does the SSPI attempt to measure the policies in this category, and what are its shortcomings and strengths?

- The SSPI does well at covering all of the primary outcome/supply components of energy (generation, supply, pollution). One shortcoming I notice is the lack of measuring inputs like costs. I believe an indicator to measure energy costs per country has potential to be insightful, even within the sustainability category.

### Based on your lit review, what policies seem measurable that we aren’t currently measuring?
- energy cost fluctuations
- energy accessibility
- public sector subsidized innovation/R&D within energy
- Infrastrcutre reliability, number of issues (i.e number of outages, internet service issues, water service issues, etc.)
- affordibility of services
- Infrastructure maintenance and lifecycle costs, i.e. policy on servicing old infrastructure
- Innovation within infrastructure, how often is new/different types of infrascturcture proposed
