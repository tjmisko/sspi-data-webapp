# Infrastructure
## First Impressions of the Category (a bullet point list of ideas of policies, a sentence or two each):
### What policies would the best governments be implementing to support well-being or sustainability in relation to this category?
- Immediate first thoughts would be public transportation, roads, bridges, etc, 
- Measuring transportation network specifically their usage and maintenance, and creating policies based on that decide best future course of action with transportation. 
- Countries would subsidize private sector, or distribute through public goods to(whichever one for best outcome): give clean water to as close to 100% of residents as possible, provide stable internet connection to as close to 100% of residents as possible
- Countries have robust public transporation networks, and inventivize/design them in such a way that maximizes their usage
- Countries are able to maintain their existing buildings and roads, and also are able to keep public facilities as clean as possbile (standout example is Singapore)

### If we weren’t constrained by data, what would we measure in this category to assess policies across countries?
- check usage of public transportation to make sure it isn't wasted
- clean, accessible access to drinking water across all countries
- avg. commute time for all citizens who use public transport, good measure of public transport's robustness
- internet speed in countries, test of internet quality
- investment levels in infrastructure projects relative to quantified public need of said projects 
- percentage of projects completed on time according to specifications and budget
- percentage of project that integrate green/sustainable energy systems into their projects

## Literature Review (review at least 1-2 sources per category, record links/informal citations so we can find them and outline how they fit together → this is an ongoing assignment):
### Sources: 
1. “The Impact of Infrastructure on Development Outcomes” — Foster et al. (World Bank Policy Research Working Paper)
2. “Infrastructure and Development: A Critical Appraisal of the Macro-Level Empirical Literature” — Straub (2011)

### What policies do countries actually pursue, and what are their successes, limitations, failures and/or unintended consequences?
- Countries pursue public investment programs, regional revitalization, and regulatory reforms around project procurement and appraisal
- Affordable housing projects, subsidizing sustainable/green energy infrastructure
Limitations and downsides: 
- With public investment programs and regional revitalization, those project can displace current residents (gentrification). 
- With this format of action, funding for large issues, the budget may not be best designed resulting in wasteful spending, issues with project timelines, project feasibility. 
### What are the scholarly debates? What is the general consensus and what are the fringe ideas?
- Should infrastructure be public sector or private sector driven?
- General consensus is that infrastructure is a public good and should be funded by the public sector
- Fringe arguments for infrastructure quality and cost efficency through competitve markets are also interesting.
- Does infrastructure drive economic growth?
- General consensus: strong correlation between infrastructure and living standards within countries
- Fringe arguments: Overinvestment results in negative returns from projects, potential inverse causality between richer countries and infrastrucutre project funding.
- Should countried borrow a lot for infrastructure projects?
- Consensus: Borrowing for productive infrastructure can be justified if returns exceed financing costs.
- Disagreement: How to define “productive” — long-term social benefits (e.g., clean water) are hard to monetize, so some projects get underfunded,
- Who benefits most from infrastructure investment?
- Consensus: Infrastructure projects prioritze urban/city environments
- Debate: How to design infrastructure that is inclusive to lower income, rural, and marginalized communities as well.

### What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?
- administrative spending and project databases
- construction/contract data 
- household access metrics (water, electricity)
- traffic & transit usage
- satellite imagery (for some asset monitoring) 
- macro time-series (productivity measures).

## Looking at the SSPI:
### How does the SSPI attempt to measure the policies in this category, and what are its shortcomings and strengths?

- The SSPI focuses on water distribution, electricity, and internet access, while also covering transportation. It covers water and internet distribution comprehensively. Sanitation appears to be well covered also.

- Shortcomings: 
- The ELectricity access is based off of survey data and not a dataset that could potentially measure power outages, availability throughout the day, etc. Minor shortcoming in having survey data as specific data would be very dificult to source. 

- The shortcoming in transportation data is that we simply measure density of networks and not usage. Another aspect we don't measure is project spending relative to budget, meeting timelines for projects, etc. which is meaningful. Could make for an interesting indicator.
