# Global Role
## First Impressions of the Category (a bullet point list of ideas of policies, a sentence or two each):
### What policies would the best governments be implementing to support well-being or sustainability in relation to this category?
- Best governments would foster strong international relationships with foreign parties and maintain open dialogues of communication with them
- Governments would be involved in conflict mediation and be, for example, hosting peace talks and conferences
- Governments would contribute to global causes for both peace and general wellbeing like peacekeeping forces, foreign aid, etc.
- Governments would also need to align to global goals, laws, and other standards (ie Paris climate accords, UN regulations)
- Governments should have strong regulation on illicit activities, especially those that impact foreign neighbors (ie: drug & human trafficking)
- Governments may choose either stronger or weaker immigration laws to promote/discourage the flow of people in and out of the country

### If we weren’t constrained by data, what would we measure in this category to assess policies across countries?
- Contribution to global programs (ie UN peacekeepers)
- Cooperation with global entities (ie UN, Climate Bills, Non-Proliferation treaties)
- Strength of relationships with other countries
- Support for global health initiatives
- Humanitarian assistance
- Policies facilitating the transfer of technology & knowledge
- Immigration/emmigration levels

## Literature Review (review at least 1-2 sources per category, record links/informal citations so we can find them and outline how they fit together → this is an ongoing assignment):
### Sources:
- Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development | Department of Economic and Social Affairs
- Publication: World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development
- Society | OECD
- Global Trends report 2024 | UNHCR
- https://academic.oup.com/sipri-yearbook?login=false

### What policies do countries actually pursue, and what are their successes, limitations, failures and/or unintended consequences?
- Many countries only receive aid post-conflict to help shape their future, and different countries get different levels of aids depending on their strategic interests
- Many countries struggle with letting in too much immigration
- Countries have been able to provide aid to other, worse-off countries in the world and have been able to make a big impact
- UN peacekeeping forces are controversial and have arguably done more harm than good in some regions of the world
- International trade has opened up possibilities for people globally but it has also “hurt” workers on a domestic scale and allowed for “neo-imperialist” exploitations of developing economies

### What are the scholarly debates? What is the general consensus and what are the fringe ideas?
- Debates on immigration and whether open borders are good or bad
- UN Position
- ensure safe, orderly and regular migration
- full respect for human rights and the humane treatment of migrants,  refugees, and displaced persons regardless of status. 
- cooperation should strengthen the resilience of communities hosting refugees, particularly in developing countries
- right of migrants to return to their country of citizenship
- States must ensure that their returning nationals are duly received.
- Debates on whether or not to share IP and outsource
- UN Position
- Enhance access to science, technology and innovation
- Enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms
- In particular at the United Nations level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanism
- Debates on whether or not to fund & support international education
- As can be predicted, there's not as much general consensus on these policies compared to other categories. Different world views and foreign policies promote different goals and believe different things

### What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?
- UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation
- UN Peacekeeping Fact Sheets
- SIPRI Yearbook
- UN Treaty Collection
- Paris Climate Accord Compliance Reports
- OECD DAC stats
- World Bank Aid Flows
- UNHCR Global Trends & Database
- IOM World Migration Database
- UNODC Global reports
- Interpol Annual Reports
- UNESCO Institute for Statistics
- World Bank Innovation & Technology Transfer Indicators
- WTO Trade Profiles
- UNCTAD Global Trade Database
- International Trust Indices
- High trust in international partners correlates with willingness to participate in global initiatives
## Looking at the SSPI:
### How does the SSPI attempt to measure the policies in this category, and what are its shortcomings and strengths?
- The SSPI covers some basic but effective policies such as military spending, research spending, and foreign aid spending. It does so through an understandable system of metrics
- The SSPI’s shortcomings are that it fails to account for some expanded factors, perhaps most importantly of which is a country’s qualitative role in the international community. Some countries are peacemakers, some are extremely open, some are very well integrated - - into the global community, and those factors are not represented. 

### Based on your lit review, what policies seem measurable that we aren’t currently measuring?
- International Education
- Number of students studying abroad (ie given grants to)
- Number of foreign students studying in your country
- Migration patterns
- Net migration rate
- Number of refugees
- Internally displaced persons
- International Trade
- Percentage of Trade from Preferential Agreements
- Foreign Aid Contributions
- Net official development assistance
- Participation percentage in global agreements
- Strength of International Relationships
- Passport strength
