# First Impression of the Category
   ## What policies other governments are implementing to support well-being in education 
        1. Creating an electric metro transportation system in Lima, Peru
            - Regular commuters had to pay a flat fee of 1.50 PEN, approximately 0.50 USD, for regular commuters, but college students received a 50% discount.
            - caused an increase in attendance and a safer option for women who were concerned about femicide cases in Peru.
        2. Growth of job opportunities for teachers in Singapore, making the profession attractive and providing constant teacher training

   ## If we were not constained by data, what would we measure in this category to assess policy across countries (what other indicators)
        - Bus or metro transportation to school
        -  Number of lines that are accessible in rural and urban areas 
        - Is transportation accessible to both private and public
        - Job growth for teachers
        - Teachers salary

  ## What policies do countries actually pursue, what are their limitation, successes, failures and or unintended consequences
        Policies: 
            - They focused on the first line of the Metro de Lima and the Metropolitano’s new stations.
        Successes: 
            - Reducing transportation costs and time for thousands of students in Peru’s capital. More access to college campuses. 
            - A 20% reduction in commuting time for private colleges and a 14% reduction for public colleges relative to the baseline
            - When examining the dynamics of the effects, they observed that college enrollment rates increase since the first year after station openings, and the magnitude of the effects doubles to a 2.5 percentage point increase after three years.

	      Failures/Unintended consequences: 
            - Metro Lima took 40 years to complete. 
            - Overestimated demand for these transit lines and had to cancel the project for a few years.
            - A lot of issues with transit regulations are increasing the number of accidents among young people
            - Delays are mostly due to several corruption scandals involving Garcia’s government and Odebrecht, which allegedly paid more than 20 million USD in bribes for this project.
  ## What are the scholarly debates 
        - The advantages of attending college may be limited when students opt for institutions that do not offer the best possible career prospects post-graduation.
        - Even though women may be more likely to graduate and secure employment, their choice to attend lower-return colleges can impede their progress in breaking through the existing glass ceiling.
        - They state that non-poor students show negative effects, students who are enrolling in both public and low-quality colleges. Their theory is that they either had job opportunities and they decided to drop out, or they got discouraged by not being in a high-quality college. I personally don’t think that conclusion might be an accurate explanation of this, although they are good thoughts. 
  ## What data is being used to measure policy and its effects? How is it being quantitatively analyzed?
        College Enrollment: 
            - Data on college enrollment come from the Peruvian Ministry of Education. Contains information about students’ year of enrollment, college, home address, major, age, and gender. 
        Geocoded college campuses: 
            - Locations of 44 college campuses in Lima’s metro area. The addresses obtained from the 2010 university census compiled by the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI).
        Peruvian Census: 
            -  The 2007–2017 Peruvian Census data come from the INEI.
        Transportation: 
            - Data on stations from the new transportation systems come from the Autoridad de Transporte Urbano para Lima y Callao (ATU).
        Commuting time: 
            - Calculated the average commuting time from a student’s household to any college in the city, with and without the new systems in place.
        Safety for women:  
            - Data on feminicides collected by the Peruvian Ministry of Women's Affairs and Vulnerable Populations (Aurora Program).
        Labor market returns:
            - Labor market outcomes compiled by the Peruvian Ministry of Labor (Planilla Electronica)


        How is it being quantitatively analyzed: 
            - Casual research: Used a control group from the neighborhoods that could have been affected by the new transportation system.
            - They used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression exclusively on the untreated observations. Next, the estimator extrapolates the data to impute the potential outcome in the absence of the treatment. 


# Literature Review 2
  [Research Paper 2: Singapore education](https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2412&context=capstone)
  ## What policies do countries actually pursue, what are their limitation, successes, failures and or unintended consequences
        Policies
           - Growth of job opportunities for teachers in Singapore, making the profession attractive and providing constant teacher training. 
        Successes: 
          - Figure 1 shows the PISA science score of Singapore, which is 555, higher than the average (500).
          - Figure 2 shows score points in science for per hour of total learning time. It is even lower (425) than the average OECD (450) scores
        Failures/unintended consequences:
          - The lack of education policy materials is one of the obstacles. The education guidelines and policy documents are only available for Singapore citizens.

  ## What are the scholarly debates 
        - The result suggests that a close connection between educators, researchers, human resources management, culture-linked systems, and continuous iteration of education reforms is critical for strong education practices globally.  
  ## What data is being used to measure policy and its effects? How is it being quantitatively analyzed?
        Data:
          - They have limited access to policy and data. However, they used scatter plots to see the PISA Science Score of Singapore in 2015, the Score points in Science per hour of total learning time, and Total learning time, in hours per week in comparison to other countries. 

        How is it being quantitatively analyzed: 
          - They rely on the MOE website, Education Minister's speeches, some brochures for parents who will send their children to primary school, a documentary called "A quiet revolution: Singapore's world-class educational system" and as well as teachers' and parents' interviews. 

# Looking at the SSPI 
  ## How does the SSPI attempt to measure policies in education and what are its shortcoming and strengths?
        - SSPI is not looking at the different income levels and their access to private and public education 
        - They are also not looking at enrollment by gender 
        - No information about how many schools are available in a city 
        - No information on graduation rates 
        - No information on the teacher’s profession growth 
        - No information on teachers’ average salary 
        - I like the student-to-teacher ratio 

  ## Based on lit review what policies seem measurable that we are not currently measuring?
        - Number of colleges/schools per district 
        - Number of bus lines 
        - Free transportation to kindergarten/middle school/high school, or college
        - Graduation rates
        - Average teacher’s salary in comparison to other high-paying professions 
        - Teachers profession growth
