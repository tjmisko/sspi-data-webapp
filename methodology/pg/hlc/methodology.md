# Thoughts & Questions
* What level are we pegging this healthcare at, given that we are currently focused on more developed countries?

## Pursued Policies - successes, limitations, failures and unintended consequences
In developing countries, there are two models of healthcare provision: 
* Comprehensive primary healthcare which requires a change in socioeconomic status, distribution of resources, a focus on health system development, and emphasis on basic health services. It was considered too idealistic and expensive.
* Selective primary healthcare, as currently used, is more disease-focused.


## Academic Debates 
There are three main structures of healthcare funding: 
* Beveridge model: based on taxation and has many public providers. Creates higher costs but high accessibility and quality
* Bismarck ‘mixed’ model: funded by a premium financed social insurance system and with a mixture of public and private providers. Creates lower costs with high accessibility and quality 
* Private Insurance model: only in existence in the US. Both hgh costs and low access, lowly ranked on quality paramaters 

The main debate is centred on how healthcare provision should work in developing countries, and whether the current services are efficient and comprehensive enough. 

## Data 
What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?
