## Pursued Policies - successes, limitations, failures and unintended consequences
There are a few ways of approaching healthcare policies 
* Coverage and access policies 
* Financing and cost control policies 
* Service delivery and quality policies 
* Preventive and public health policies (vaccinations, education, nudging)
* Healthcare research innovation policies 

## Academic Debates 
There is consensus on the following topics 
* Healthcare is a public good
* There is a need to balance between efficiency and equity of services 
* Preventive care is better than responsive care 

There are debates around which is the better funding model and how much private companies should be involved, which can be categorised as: 
* Beveridge model: based on taxation and has many public providers. Creates higher costs but high accessibility and quality
* Bismarck ‘mixed’ model: funded by a premium financed social insurance system and with a mixture of public and private providers. Creates lower costs with high accessibility and quality 
* Private Insurance model: only in existence in the US. Both high costs and low access, lowly ranked on quality parameters 

There are also debates on resource allocation and priority-setting. This extends to the developing countries and whether disease-specific intervention is the best approach. 

## Data 
What data is used in the literature to measure policy and its effects? How is it quantitatively analyzed?
Found [here](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators). 
* Spatial accessibility of health care
* Life expectancy (at birth, at 60)
* Mortality 
* Disability adjusted life years (DALYs)
* Suicide rates 
* Road traffic deaths and accidents 
* Deaths due to unintentional poisoning 
* Deaths due to noncommunicable diseases 
* Maternal mortality 
* Electrification of healthcare facilities 
* Health infrastructure and systems 
* Alcohol/substance use 
* Air pollution
* Antimicrobial resistance 
* Assistive technology 

# Looking at the SSPI 
Strengths of current measurement: 
* Comprehensive overview, especially with the use of indices, since some areas of safety are harder to quantify 

Weaknesses of current measurement: 
* Unclear what level of healthcare we are pegging this at, given that the current countries are developed ones and many of the indicators are bigger issues in developing countries 

Policies that could be measured: 
* Accessibility of healthcare services via costs and geographical proximity 
* Quality of the service via approximated waiting time for each category of severity 
* Mental health services via number of trained practitioners per capita
