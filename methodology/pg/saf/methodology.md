# First Impressions of the Category 
* Enforcement strength  
  * Number of security officers per capita 
  * Number of reported cases per number of officers (whether officers have enough bandwidth)
* Effectiveness of deterrence
  * Number of crimes (confounded with the ability to detect cases)
* Effectiveness of prisons 
  * Recidivism rates 
* Rates of substance abuse (is this public safety?)
  * Prevalence of addiction 
  * Support system for substance abusers 
* Road safety
  * Number of accidents per capita 
* Prevalence of violence 
  * Petty crime rates (e.g., knife crimes, theft)
  * Violent crime rates (homicide)
* Involvement in international wars? 
  * Likelihood of civil disruption

## Pursued Policies - successes, limitations, failures and unintended consequences
* Crime prevention and law enforcement 
  * With existing crime and legislation, it is often hard to change the boundary of where it is drawn due to inertia with the status quo  
  * Law enforcement is also hard when there is low trust in the policing body 
* Emergency management and disaster preparedness (both natural and man-made emergencies)
  * With natural disaster preparedness, infrastructure plays a key role which might be costly to change 
  * Managing the people due times of emergency requires high trust in the government 
* Cybersecurity 
  * Requires mass education campaigns 

## Academic Debates 
Most debates fall along the lines of 
* Reliance on deterrence and punishment vs prevention and social investment 
* Deterrent-based (visible authority) vs community (fairness, transparency) approach of officers 
* The extent of state surveillance necessary for public safety
* Incorporating technology into public safety and the potential biases
* The severity of punishment 

There are also smaller fringe debates surrounding 
* Abolishing prisons (due to the emphasis on punishments rather than social support)

  * Housing provision 

# Looking at the SSPI 
Strengths of current measurement: 
* Comprehensive overview, especially with the use of indices, since some areas of safety are harder to quantify 

Weaknesses of current measurement: 
* Some areas which are typically considered are not. 

Random thoughts: 
* Is there a reason the severity of crime is measured at homicides (lower likelihood for incomplete data)
* What is our take on using other indicators which already exist? 

Policies that could be measured: 
* Effectiveness of prisons via recidivism rates 
* Proportion of people who face substance abuse difficulties (might be hard to find accurate data)
* Rate of homelessness (homeless people are a lot more likely to face safety hazards)
* Road safety via number of accidents per capita 
* Index for involvement in wars (likelihood of civil disruption)
* Index for disaster preparedness
