DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Pre-tax National Income Thresholds (Equal-split Adults)
DatasetCode: WID_NINCTH_PRETAX_EQUALSPLIT_P0P100
Description: Pre-tax national income percentile threshold values for equal-split adults. Resources are split equally within couples while the base unit remains the individual. Pre-tax national income is the sum of all pre-tax personal income flows accruing to labor and capital, before taxes and transfers but after pension operations. Shows the income threshold values (in USD) that define different percentiles.

# Pre-Tax National Income

## Overview

This dataset from the World Inequality Database (WID) measures **pre-tax national income** across income and wealth distributions. Percentile (i.e. threshold ) value at pX, whether the percentile is of the form 'pX' or of the form 'pXpY'

## Variable Details

- **WID Variable Code**: `tptincj992`
- **Measurement Category**: Income Distribution
- **Unit**: USD
- **Measurement Type**: Threshold
- **Population Coverage**: The base unit is the individual (rather than the household) but resources are split equally within couples.. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20.

## Technical Description

Pre-tax national income =Pre-tax labor income [total pre-tax income ranking]+Pre-tax capital income [total pre-tax income ranking]

## Methodology

Methodological details follow WID.world standards for distributional analysis. Specific methodology details not available in metadata.

## Usage in SSPI Context

This WID indicator contributes to the SSPI's comprehensive analysis of social and economic inequality patterns. The distributional nature of this data enables:

- Cross-country inequality comparisons
- Temporal analysis of distribution changes
- Policy impact assessment across income/wealth percentiles
- Integration with other SSPI indicators for multi-dimensional analysis

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Methodology Notes
- Data follows WID.world collection and estimation standards
- Quality varies by country based on available source data
- Distributional estimates may involve modeling and imputation
- Users should consult WID documentation for country-specific notes

### Temporal Coverage
- Coverage varies by country and indicator
- Generally focuses on post-2000 period for SSPI integration
- Some historical data available depending on source availability
