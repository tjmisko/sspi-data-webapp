# Personal Carbon Footprint - Investment (Full Distribution)

## Overview

This dataset provides investment-based carbon inequality data from the World Inequality Database (WID), specifically measuring personal carbon footprints from investment activities across the complete income distribution. This represents one of the four core distributional carbon indicators essential for studying wealth-based carbon inequality research.

## Variable Details

- **WID Variable Code**: `lifghgi999`
- **Unit**: tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita (tCO2 equivalent/cap)
- **Scope**: Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 + other greenhouse gases)
- **Coverage**: Full income distribution (p0p100)
- **Population**: All ages (999)

## Methodology

The estimates are based on modeled calculations that systematically combine:

- Survey and tax data
- National accounts
- Environmental Input-Output tables

The methodology includes emissions embedded in imports and exports of goods and services, providing an investment-based accounting approach that captures carbon footprints associated with capital formation and firm ownership across wealth percentiles.

## Emissions Scope

This indicator specifically measures emissions associated with:

- **Individual investments**: Capital formation attributed to individual firm owners
- **Business ownership**: Emissions from productive assets owned by individuals

**Exclusions**: This indicator does NOT include emissions associated with individual consumption or government collective expenditures.

## Research Applications

### Carbon Inequality Analysis
- Study how investment-based carbon footprints vary across wealth percentiles
- Analyze the relationship between capital ownership and carbon emissions
- Examine wealth-driven climate inequality patterns

### Policy Relevance
- **Wealth-Based Carbon Policies**: Understanding distributional impacts of investment-focused climate policies
- **Capital Tax Design**: Informing carbon-conscious wealth taxation approaches
- **Climate Justice**: Quantifying investment emission inequality for equity considerations
- **Corporate Responsibility**: Targeting high-investment groups for sustainable investment initiatives

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Quality Assessment
The authors note that data quality is "low to very low" due to:
- Limited pollution data availability in most countries
- Complex attribution of investment emissions across wealth distributions
- Methodological challenges in linking capital ownership to emissions

### Methodological Considerations
- Investment-based measures show higher inequality than consumption-only approaches
- Results vary significantly depending on how capital formation is attributed
- Represents pioneering work in wealth-based carbon footprint measurement

## Investment vs Consumption Perspective

This dataset is crucial for understanding that carbon inequality increases significantly when factoring in investment-related emissions compared to consumption-only measures. The separation allows researchers to:

- Distinguish between lifestyle-driven vs wealth-driven emissions
- Analyze different policy intervention points
- Understand the full spectrum of personal carbon responsibility

## Geographic and Temporal Coverage

- **Countries**: Available for 169+ countries globally
- **Time Period**: Generally 1990-2019 with some extrapolation to 2020
- **Update Frequency**: Based on availability of underlying survey, tax, and environmental data

## Research Priority

**HIGH** - This is a core indicator for investment-based carbon inequality analysis and is essential for understanding how capital ownership and wealth concentration drive carbon emissions inequality, complementing consumption-based measures.
