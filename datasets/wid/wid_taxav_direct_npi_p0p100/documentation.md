# Direct Taxes

## Overview

This dataset from the World Inequality Database (WID) measures **direct taxes** across income and wealth distributions. Average income or wealth between two percentiles. When the associated percentile is of the form 'pX', intermediary average returns the average between percentile pX and the next consecutive percentile. When the associated percentile is of the form 'pXpY', the variable returns the average between percentiles pX and pY.

## Variable Details

- **WID Variable Code**: `ataxnpi992`
- **Measurement Category**: Taxation
- **Unit**: USD
- **Measurement Type**: Average
- **Population Coverage**: The base unit is the individual (rather than the household). This is equivalent to assuming no sharing of resources within couples.. The population is comprised of individuals over age 20.

## Technical Description

[Direct taxes]=[Social contributions]+[Personal taxes on income and wealth]

## Methodology

WID.world estimations as a proportion of GDP based on the following; 1970â€“2018: OECD. These estimates are then anchored to GDP (see GDP variable for details). The estimates of national accounts subcomponents in the WID are based on official country data and use the methodology presented in the DINA guidelines. We stress that these subcomponents estimates are more fragile than those of main aggregates such as national income. Countries may use classifications used are not always fully consistent with other countries or over time. Series breaks with no real economic significance can appear as a result. The WID include these estimates to provide a centralized source for this official data, so that it can be exploited more directly. We encourage users of this data to be careful and to pay attention to the source of the data, which we systematically indicate.

## Population and Demographic Details

### Coverage
- **Population Base**: The base unit is the individual (rather than the household). This is equivalent to assuming no sharing of resources within couples.
- **Age Groups**: The population is comprised of individuals over age 20.

### Measurement Approach
- **Type**: Average
- **Description**: Average income or wealth between two percentiles. When the associated percentile is of the form 'pX', intermediary average returns the average between percentile pX and the next consecutive percentile. When the associated percentile is of the form 'pXpY', the variable returns the average between percentiles pX and pY.

## Usage in SSPI Context

This WID indicator contributes to the SSPI's comprehensive analysis of social and economic inequality patterns. The distributional nature of this data enables:

- Cross-country inequality comparisons
- Temporal analysis of distribution changes
- Policy impact assessment across income/wealth percentiles
- Integration with other SSPI indicators for multi-dimensional analysis

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Methodology Notes
- Data follows WID.world collection and estimation standards
- Quality varies by country based on available source data
- Distributional estimates may involve modeling and imputation
- Users should consult WID documentation for country-specific notes

### Temporal Coverage
- Coverage varies by country and indicator
- Generally focuses on post-2000 period for SSPI integration
- Some historical data available depending on source availability

## Related Indicators

This indicator is part of WID's comprehensive distributional database and can be analyzed alongside other SSPI inequality measures for holistic understanding of social and economic patterns.
