# Personal CO2 Footprint (Full Distribution)

## Overview

This dataset provides CO2-specific carbon inequality data from the World Inequality Database (WID), measuring personal carbon dioxide footprints across the complete income distribution. This represents the CO2-only version of the comprehensive carbon footprint indicators, focusing specifically on carbon dioxide emissions while excluding other greenhouse gases.

## Variable Details

- **WID Variable Code**: `lpfcari999`
- **Unit**: tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita (tCO2 equivalent/cap)
- **Scope**: Carbon dioxide (CO2) only - excludes other greenhouse gases
- **Coverage**: Full income distribution (p0p100)
- **Population**: All ages (999)

## Methodology

The estimates are based on modeled calculations that systematically combine:

- Survey and tax data
- National accounts
- Environmental Input-Output tables

The methodology includes CO2 emissions embedded in imports and exports of goods and services, providing a consumption-based accounting approach focused specifically on carbon dioxide emissions across income percentiles.

## Emissions Scope

This indicator specifically measures CO2 emissions associated with personal carbon footprints, including both:

- **Individual consumption and government collective expenditures**
- **Individual investments and capital formation**

**Key Distinction**: Unlike the comprehensive greenhouse gas indicators, this measure focuses exclusively on CO2 emissions, making it suitable for analysis requiring specific focus on carbon dioxide rather than broader greenhouse gas impacts.

## Research Applications

### CO2-Specific Inequality Analysis
- Study carbon dioxide inequality patterns across income distributions
- Analyze CO2-focused climate policies and their distributional impacts
- Compare CO2 vs broader greenhouse gas inequality patterns
- Examine carbon dioxide responsibility for specific policy applications

### Policy Relevance
- **CO2-Specific Carbon Pricing**: Understanding distributional impacts of carbon dioxide pricing mechanisms
- **Carbon Tax Design**: Informing tax policies focused specifically on CO2 emissions
- **Climate Justice**: CO2-specific assessment of emission responsibility
- **Sectoral Analysis**: Focus on CO2-intensive industries and consumption patterns

## CO2 vs Greenhouse Gas Comparison

This dataset enables important analytical distinctions:

- **CO2 Focus**: Isolates carbon dioxide patterns from broader greenhouse gas impacts
- **Policy Specificity**: Many climate policies target CO2 specifically
- **Sectoral Analysis**: CO2 patterns may differ from other greenhouse gases
- **Measurement Precision**: CO2 data often has better quality than other greenhouse gas estimates

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Quality Assessment
The authors note that data quality is "low to very low" due to:
- Limited pollution data availability in most countries
- Attribution challenges across income distributions
- Methodological complexity in CO2-specific measurement

### Methodological Considerations
- CO2-only measures may underestimate total climate impact compared to comprehensive greenhouse gas indicators
- Results provide important subset analysis for CO2-focused research and policy
- Represents subset of broader carbon inequality measurement efforts

## Comparative Analysis Applications

This dataset is particularly valuable for:
- **CO2 vs GHG Comparisons**: Understanding the role of CO2 within broader greenhouse gas patterns
- **Policy-Specific Analysis**: Research focused on CO2-targeting policies
- **Sector Studies**: Analysis of CO2-intensive industries and consumption
- **International Comparisons**: Countries with different greenhouse gas profiles

## Geographic and Temporal Coverage

- **Countries**: Available for 169+ countries globally
- **Time Period**: Generally 1990-2019 with some extrapolation to 2020
- **Update Frequency**: Based on availability of underlying survey, tax, and environmental data

## Research Priority

**MEDIUM** - This indicator is valuable for CO2-specific analysis and research requiring focus on carbon dioxide rather than broader greenhouse gas emissions. Complements the comprehensive greenhouse gas indicators for specialized research applications.
