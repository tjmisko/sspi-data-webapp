DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Post-tax National Income Ratios (Equal-split Adults)
DatasetCode: WID_NINCRAT_POSTTAX_EQUALSPLIT_P0P100
Description: Inequality ratios for post-tax national income among equal-split adults, typically measuring the ratio of top 10% average income to bottom 50% average income. Resources are split equally within couples while the base unit remains the individual. Post-tax national income is the sum of primary incomes from all sectors minus taxes, reflecting income distribution after the operation of the tax and transfer system.
