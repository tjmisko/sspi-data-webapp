DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Net Personal Wealth Gender Breakdown - Full Population
DatasetCode: WID_WEALTHBRK_NET_GENDER_P0P100
Description: Gender breakdown coefficients for net personal wealth distribution. Uses beta coefficients (inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient) to analyze gender differences in wealth distribution. Net personal wealth is the total value of non-financial and financial assets (housing, land, deposits, bonds, equities, etc.) held by households, minus their debts. Shows how wealth distribution varies by gender.

# Net Personal Wealth

## Overview

This dataset from the World Inequality Database (WID) measures **net personal wealth** across income and wealth distributions. The beta coefficient corresponds to the inverted Pareto-Lorenz coefficient. It is equal to mean income over a certain income level divided by this level. A coefficient b=2=200% for an income level 100 000 EUR means that the average income above 100 000 EUR is 200 000 EUR, a coefficient of 3 or 300% at income level 1 000 000 EUR means that the average income level above 1 000 000 EUR in a given population is 3 000 000 EUR.

## Population and Demographic Details

### Coverage
- **Population Base**: The base unit is the individual (rather than the household) but resources are split equally within couples.
- **Age Groups**: The population is comprised of individuals over age 20.

## Usage in SSPI Context

This WID indicator contributes to the SSPI's comprehensive analysis of social and economic inequality patterns. The distributional nature of this data enables:

- Cross-country inequality comparisons
- Temporal analysis of distribution changes
- Policy impact assessment across income/wealth percentiles
- Integration with other SSPI indicators for multi-dimensional analysis

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Methodology Notes
- Data follows WID.world collection and estimation standards
- Quality varies by country based on available source data
- Distributional estimates may involve modeling and imputation
- Users should consult WID documentation for country-specific notes

### Temporal Coverage
- Coverage varies by country and indicator
- Generally focuses on post-2000 period for SSPI integration
- Some historical data available depending on source availability
