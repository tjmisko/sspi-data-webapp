DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Pre-tax National Income Ratios (Equal-split Adults)
DatasetCode: WID_NINCRAT_PRETAX_EQUALSPLIT_P0P100
Description: Inequality ratios for pre-tax national income among equal-split adults, typically measuring the ratio of top 10% average income to bottom 50% average income. Resources are split equally within couples while the base unit remains the individual. Pre-tax national income is the sum of all pre-tax personal income flows accruing to labor and capital, before taxes and transfers but after pension operations.
