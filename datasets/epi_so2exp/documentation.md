DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: SO2 exposure
DatasetCode: EPI_SO2EXP
Description: We measure exposure to ground-level sulfur dioxide using a country’s ambient ground-level concentration. The pollutant concentration is population-weighted to better capture the exposure levels in geographic areas with a higher human population density. A score of 100 indicates a country has among the lowest exposure  in the world (≤5th-percentile)
