DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Adjusted emissions growth rate for carbon dioxide
DatasetCode: EPI_CO2GRW_ADJ
Description: We calculate the CO2 growth rate indicator as the average annual rate of CO2 emissions over the years 2013–2022. We then adjust for economic trends to isolate change due to policy effort rather than economic fluctuation. A score of 100 indicates a country is cutting emissions by ≥13% per year
