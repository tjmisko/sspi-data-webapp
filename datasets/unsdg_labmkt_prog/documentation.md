SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Labour Market Programs Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of population covered by labour market programs. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Population covered by active labour market policies
- Job training and skill development programs
- Employment services and job placement programs
- Public works programs
- Wage subsidies and employment incentives

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group (youth, adults, older workers)
- Education level
- Employment status (unemployed, underemployed)
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)

Labour market programs include:
- Job training and vocational education
- Public employment programs
- Job search assistance
- Employment subsidies
- Entrepreneurship support programs

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring workers have access to adequate labour market support and measures the effectiveness of active labour market policies in promoting employment and reducing unemployment.
