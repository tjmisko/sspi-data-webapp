DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Adjusted emissions growth rate for nitrous oxide
DatasetCode: EPI_NO2GRW_ADJ
Description: We calculate the nitrous oxide growth rate indicator as the average annual rate of nitrous oxide emissions over the years 2013-2022. We then adjust for economic trends to isolate change due to policy effort rather than economic fluctuation.  A score of 100 indicates a country is cutting emissions by â‰¥5% per year
