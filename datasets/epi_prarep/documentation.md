Description: The Protected Areas Representativeness Index (PARI) indicator measures how well terrestrial protected areas represent the ecological diversity of a country. This metric is calculated by CSIRO (https://geobon.org/ebvs/indicators/protected-area-representatives-connectedness-indices/) using high-resolution remote sensing data and biological records of species' locations. A score of 100 indicates that a country's terrestrial protected areas nearly perfectly represent the country's ecosystem diversity
