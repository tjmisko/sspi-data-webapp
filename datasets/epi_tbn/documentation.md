DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: Terrestrial Biome Protection (national weights)
DatasetCode: EPI_TBN
Description: We derive the terrestrial biome protection indicator by first calculating the proportion of each biome in a country that lies within a protected area. We then give greater weight to biomes that are relatively rare within a country – and less weight to prevalent biomes – before aggregating the proportions. A score of 100 indicates that a country protects at least 30% of each of its biome types
