Stockholm Convention: 
1. Designation of the Stockholm Convention official contact points and national focal points; 
2. Submission of the national implementation plans;  
3. Submission of the revised national implementation plan addressing amendments;  
4. Submission of the national reports.

Under the Stockholm Convention, a Party has an obligation to report on the
measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on
the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the
Convention. The national reports include statistical data on the total
quantities of production, import and export of each of the chemicals
listed in Annex A and Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and
to the extent practicable, a list of the States from which it has imported
each substance and the States to which it has exported each substance. A
National Implementation Plan under the Stockholm Convention is a plan
explaining how a Party is going to implement the obligations under the
Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into operation (Article 7).
Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to the Convention or
its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into the annexes of
the Convention, will require that a Party is to  review and update its
implementation plan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference of
the Parties (COP) within two years of the entry into force of the
amendment for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention
(according to paragraph 7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).  

For the Stockholm Convention the units of
measurements are the transmission of information, such as the number of
country contacts designated, number of national reports, national
implementation plans and import responses. For each Party, a percentage
value is assigned to indicate how much of the required information has
been submitted. 

Stockholm Convention: Pursuant to Article 9 of the Stockholm Convention,
each Party shall designate a national focal point for the exchange of the
information referred to in paragraph 1 of article 9. Pursuant to decision
SC-2/16 of the second meeting of the COP of the Stockholm Convention,
Parties are invited to nominate OCPs. A revised harmonised form for
notification of designation of contacts has also been adopted by the COP
to the Stockholm Convention for notification of contacts, including
modifications (decision SC-6/26). The Secretariat also maintains for this
Convention a database of country contacts. 

Parties to the Stockholm Convention are required to develop, endeavour to
implement, update and review as appropriate, a plan explaining how they
are going to implement the obligations under the Convention (Article 7)
(“national implementation plans”). The plans are made available on the
Convention website.
