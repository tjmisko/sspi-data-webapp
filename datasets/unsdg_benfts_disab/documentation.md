SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Disability Benefits Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of population with severe disabilities receiving disability cash benefits. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Persons with severe disabilities receiving direct cash benefits
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Cash transfer programs specifically targeting persons with disabilities
- Protection against income loss due to disability

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group
- Type of disability (where available)
- Severity of disability
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)

Disability cash benefits include:
- Disability pensions
- Disability allowances
- Invalidity benefits
- Assistance for persons with disabilities
- Caregiver allowances

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring persons with disabilities have access to adequate social protection and measures the effectiveness of disability-focused social protection programs in reducing poverty among disabled populations and promoting inclusion.
