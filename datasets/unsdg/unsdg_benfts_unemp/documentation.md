SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Unemployment Benefits Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of unemployed persons receiving unemployment cash benefits. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Unemployed persons receiving cash support during unemployment
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Income security during job transitions
- Protection against unemployment risks

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group (youth, adults)
- Duration of unemployment
- Previous employment status (formal/informal sector)
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)

Unemployment cash benefits include:
- Unemployment insurance benefits
- Unemployment assistance payments
- Job-seeker allowances
- Severance payments
- Temporary income support for unemployed

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring unemployed persons have access to adequate income support and measures the effectiveness of unemployment protection systems in providing temporary financial security during job search periods.
