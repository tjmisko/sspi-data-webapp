Montreal Protocol: 
1. Compliance with annual reporting requirements for production and consumption
   of controlled substances under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol; 
2. Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the
   Montreal Protocol; 
3. For each party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the
   required information has been submitted. 

The Montreal Protocol requires, under its Article 7, that each Party provides
to the Secretariat for each controlled substance statistical data on its annual
production, amounts used for feedstocks, amounts destroyed by technologies
approved by the Parties, imports from and exports to Parties and non-Parties
respectively and amount of the controlled substance listed in Annex E used for
quarantine and pre- shipment applications, for the year during which provisions
concerning those substances entered into force for that Party and for each year
thereafter. Each Party shall also provide to the Secretariat statistical data
on its annual emissions of trifluoromethane (HFC-23) per facility. The
calculation of control levels is provided in Article 3 of the Protocol. This
reporting enables monitoring of the implementation of the Protocol, and
compliance with the control measures under the protocol. Additionally, under
Article 4B, each party is required to establish and implement a system for
licensing the import and export of new, used, recycled and reclaimed controlled
substances. Each Party is required, within three months of the date of
introducing its licensing system, to report to the Secretariat on the
establishment and operation of that system.  

Montreal Protocol: Under the Montreal Protocol, the role of the Secretariat is
stipulated in Article 12 of the Protocol including the obligation to receive
data provided pursuant to Article 7. Additionally, under Article 4B, each Party
is required, within three months of the date of introducing its licensing
system, to report to the Secretariat on the establishment and operation of that
system.  Compliance of the Parties with their reporting obligations is
considered by an Implementation Committee established under the Protocol’s
Non-Compliance Procedure and is determined by the Meeting of the Parties based
on the Committee’s recommendations
(https://ozone.unep.org/list-of-implementation- committee-recommendations). 

Montreal Protocol: 
1. Compliance with annual reporting requirements for production and consumption
   of controlled substances under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol (15 points
per report); 
2. Submission of information on Licensing systems under (Article 4B of) the
   Montreal Protocol (5 points). 
 
Under the Montreal Protocol, the Secretariat does not carry out any validation,
other than simple completeness and consistency checks which are communicated
back to the reporting party. There is no consultation with countries on the
national data submitted to the SDGs Indicators Database.
