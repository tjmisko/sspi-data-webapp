SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Social Insurance Programs Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of population covered by social insurance programs. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Population covered by contributory social insurance schemes
- Coverage of employment-based insurance programs
- Protection against life-cycle risks through insurance
- Access to earnings-related benefits

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group
- Employment status (formal/informal sector)
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)
- Type of social insurance scheme

Social insurance programs include:
- Employment injury insurance
- Unemployment insurance
- Old-age pension schemes
- Disability insurance
- Sickness and maternity insurance
- Health insurance

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring workers and their families have access to adequate social insurance protection and measures the effectiveness of contributory social protection systems in providing income security against life-cycle risks.
