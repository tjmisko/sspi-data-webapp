The Minamata Convention requires, under its article 17, paragraph 4, that each Party designates a National 
Focal Point for the exchange of information under it, including with regard to the consent of importing 
Parties under Article 3. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Minamata Convention, each party to the Convention 
shall report to the COP on the measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention, on 
the effectiveness of such measures and on possible challenges in meeting the objectives of the Convention. 
In decision MC-1/8 on the Timing and format of reporting by the Parties, the COP at its first meeting (2017) 
agreed on the full format of reporting and decided that each Party shall report every four years using the 
full format and report every two years on four questions marked by an asterisk in the full format. The COP 
further decided on the following timing with regards to the short and full reporting: 31 December 2019 as 
the deadline for the first  short national report; 31 December 2021 as the deadline for the first full national 
report.

points and the number of national reports received. For each Party, a percentage value is assigned to 
indicate how much of the required information has been submitted.
