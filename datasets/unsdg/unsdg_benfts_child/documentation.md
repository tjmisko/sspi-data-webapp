SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Child/Family Benefits Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of children/households receiving child/family cash benefits. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Children receiving direct cash benefits
- Households receiving family allowances or child support payments
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Cash transfer programs specifically targeting children and families

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group (children under 18)
- Household characteristics
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)

Child/family cash benefits include:
- Child allowances
- Family allowances
- Birth grants
- School feeding allowances (cash component)
- Orphan and vulnerable children support

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring children have access to adequate social protection and measures the effectiveness of child-focused social protection programs in reducing child poverty and supporting family welfare.
