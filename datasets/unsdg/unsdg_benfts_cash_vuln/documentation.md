SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Cash Benefits for Vulnerable Population:

This indicator measures the proportion of vulnerable population receiving social assistance cash benefits. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Vulnerable populations receiving targeted cash assistance
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Protection of at-risk groups through direct cash support
- Income support for those facing multiple vulnerabilities

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group
- Type of vulnerability (disability, single parenthood, ethnic minority, etc.)
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)
- Household characteristics

Cash benefits for vulnerable populations include:
- Targeted cash transfers for vulnerable groups
- Emergency cash assistance
- Vulnerability-based allowances
- Special support payments
- Crisis response cash transfers

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring vulnerable populations have access to adequate social assistance and measures the effectiveness of targeted social protection programs in providing direct income support to those facing multiple risks and disadvantages.
