SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Cash Benefits for Poor Population:

This indicator measures the proportion of poor population receiving social assistance cash benefits. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Poor populations receiving targeted cash assistance
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Effectiveness of poverty-targeted programs
- Income support for those living in poverty

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group
- Poverty level (extreme poor, moderate poor)
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)
- Household characteristics

Cash benefits for poor population include:
- Conditional cash transfers
- Unconditional cash transfers
- Poverty-targeted allowances
- Social assistance payments
- Emergency cash support

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring poor and vulnerable populations have access to adequate social assistance and measures the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs in providing direct income support to those most in need.
