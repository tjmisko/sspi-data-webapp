SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Work Injury Benefits Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of employed population covered in the event of work injury. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Employed persons covered by work injury protection
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Protection against occupational accidents and diseases
- Income security following workplace injuries

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group
- Sector of employment
- Type of employment (formal/informal sector)
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)

Work injury benefits include:
- Workers' compensation
- Occupational injury insurance
- Disability benefits from work accidents
- Medical care for work-related injuries
- Survivor benefits for work-related deaths

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring workers have access to adequate protection against occupational risks and measures the effectiveness of work injury insurance systems in providing income security and medical care following workplace accidents or occupational diseases.
