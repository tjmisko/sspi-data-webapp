### Units of Measure
For the Stockholm Convention the units of measurements are the transmission of
information, such as the number of country contacts designated, number of
national reports, national implementation plans and import responses. For each
Party, a percentage value is assigned to indicate how much of the required
information has been submitted.
### Stockholm Convention 
1. Designation of the Stockholm Convention official contact points and national
   focal points; 
2. Submission of the national implementation plans;  
3. Submission of the revised national implementation plan addressing
   amendments;  
4. Submission of the national reports.

Under the Stockholm Convention, a Party has an obligation to report on the
measures it has taken to implement the provisions of the Convention and on the
effectiveness of such measures in meeting the objectives of the Convention. The
national reports include statistical data on the total quantities of
production, import and export of each of the chemicals listed in Annex A and
Annex B or a reasonable estimate of such data; and to the extent practicable, a
list of the States from which it has imported each substance and the States to
which it has exported each substance. A National Implementation Plan under the
Stockholm Convention is a plan explaining how a Party is going to implement the
obligations under the Convention and make efforts to put such a plan into
operation (Article 7). Changes in the obligations arising from amendments to
the Convention or its annexes, for example when a new chemical is listed into
the annexes of the Convention, will require that a Party is to  review and
update its implementation plan, and transmit the updated plan to the Conference
of the Parties (COP) within two years of the entry into force of the amendment
for it, consistent with paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention (according to
paragraph 7 of the annex to decision SC-1/12).  

Stockholm Convention: Pursuant to Article 9 of the Stockholm Convention, each
Party shall designate a national focal point for the exchange of the
information referred to in paragraph 1 of article 9. Pursuant to decision
SC-2/16 of the second meeting of the COP of the Stockholm Convention, Parties
are invited to nominate OCPs. A revised harmonised form for notification of
designation of contacts has also been adopted by the COP to the Stockholm
Convention for notification of contacts, including modifications (decision
SC-6/26). The Secretariat also maintains for this Convention a database of
country contacts. 

Parties to the Stockholm Convention are required to develop, endeavour to
implement, update and review as appropriate, a plan explaining how they are
going to implement the obligations under the Convention (Article 7) (“national
implementation plans”). The plans are made available on the Convention website.
