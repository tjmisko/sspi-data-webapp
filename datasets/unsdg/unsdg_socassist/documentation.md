SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Social Assistance Programs Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of population covered by social assistance programs. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Population covered by non-contributory social assistance
- Coverage of means-tested programs
- Support for vulnerable populations through assistance programs
- Access to basic social protection floors

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group
- Income level
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)
- Vulnerability status

Social assistance programs include:
- Cash transfer programs
- Food assistance programs
- Housing assistance
- Healthcare assistance
- Education assistance
- Emergency social assistance

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring vulnerable populations have access to adequate social assistance and measures the effectiveness of social safety nets in protecting those most at risk of poverty and social exclusion.
