SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Maternity Benefits Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of mothers with newborns receiving maternity cash benefits. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Mothers receiving maternity cash benefits after childbirth
- Coverage of maternity leave benefits
- Support for maternal and newborn health through cash transfers
- Income security during maternity period

Data is disaggregated by:
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)
- Employment status (formal/informal sector)
- Age group
- Income level

Maternity cash benefits include:
- Maternity leave benefits
- Birth grants
- Maternity allowances
- Child birth bonuses
- Maternal health support payments

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring mothers have access to adequate income support during maternity and measures the effectiveness of maternal social protection programs in supporting maternal and child health and wellbeing.
