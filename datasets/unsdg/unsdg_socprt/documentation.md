SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Social Protection Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of population covered by at least one social protection benefit. It is a key indicator under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator encompasses coverage of:
1. Children
2. Unemployed persons  
3. Older persons
4. Persons with disabilities
5. Pregnant women and newborns
6. Work-injury victims
7. The poor and vulnerable populations

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Population group (as listed above)
- Type of social protection program
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)

Social protection systems include:
- Cash transfers (conditional and unconditional)
- Social insurance programs
- Social assistance programs  
- Labor market programs
- In-kind transfers

The indicator helps track progress toward universal social protection coverage and the effectiveness of national social protection systems in reaching vulnerable populations. This is the comprehensive measure that aggregates coverage across all social protection benefits.
