SDG Indicator 1.3.1 - Pension Benefits Coverage:

This indicator measures the proportion of population above statutory pensionable age receiving a pension. It is a key component under SDG Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), specifically Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.

The indicator focuses on:
- Older persons receiving pension benefits
- Coverage by sex (where data is available)
- Adequacy of pension systems
- Income security for elderly populations

Data is disaggregated by:
- Sex (where available)
- Age group (above pensionable age)
- Type of pension scheme
- Geographic location (urban/rural where available)
- Employment history (formal/informal sector)

Pension benefits include:
- Old-age pensions
- Retirement benefits
- Social pensions
- Contributory pension schemes
- Non-contributory pension schemes

The indicator helps track progress toward ensuring older persons have access to adequate income security and measures the effectiveness of pension systems in preventing poverty among the elderly.
