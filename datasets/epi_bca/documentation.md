DatasetType: Intermediate

DatasetCode: EPI_BCA
Description: We calculate the black carbon growth rate indicator as the average annual rate of black carbon emissions over the years 2013-2022. We then adjust for economic trends to isolate change due to policy effort rather than economic fluctuation.  A score of 100 indicates a country is cutting emissions by â‰¥5% per year
