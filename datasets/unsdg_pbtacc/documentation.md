Unfortunately, this dataset is not useable. It is identified at the city level, and has only one year of data (2020) for almost all countries. Certainly not for dynamic data.

It does suggest a minor redesign for the ID, since technically this cannot be a dataset according to the current definition because it is identified at the city, not the country, level. Ideally, we would be able to collect this as a dataset and supply extra ID variables (perhaps as a sub-dictionary called AdditionalId or something) to be able to make this happen.
