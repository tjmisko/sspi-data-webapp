DatasetType: Intermediate
DatasetName: VOC exposure
DatasetCode: EPI_VOCEXP
Description: We measure exposure to ground-level volatile organic compounds using a countryâ€™s ambient ground-level concentration. The pollutant concentration is population-weighted to better capture the exposure levels in geographic areas with a higher human population density. We estimate volatile organic compounds as the summed concentration of ethane
