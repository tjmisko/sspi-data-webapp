**Generated:** 2025-08-18  
**Branch:** 508-refactor-alternate-energy-to-use-all-intermediate-codes  
**Issue:** #508

## Missing Dataset Implementations

The following datasets require both `@dataset_collector` and `@dataset_cleaner` implementations:

### Recently Resolved (2025-08-18)
- [x] ~~WID_BFIFTY~~ → **WID_NINCSH_PRETAX_P0P50** (already implemented)
- [x] ~~WID_TOPTEN~~ → **WID_NINCSH_PRETAX_P90P100** (already implemented)
- [x] **ISHRAT indicator refactored** to use precise WID dataset codes

### ✅ IEA Energy Portfolio - COMPLETED (2025-08-18)
All 7 datasets needed for Alternative Energy indicator:
- [x] ~~IEA_BIOWAS~~ (Biofuels and waste) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] ~~IEA_FSLOIL~~ (Fossil fuels and oil) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] ~~IEA_GEOPWR~~ (Geothermal power) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] ~~IEA_HYDROP~~ (Hydroelectric power) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] ~~IEA_NATGAS~~ (Natural gas) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] ~~IEA_NCLEAR~~ (Nuclear energy) - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] ~~IEA_TLCOAL~~ (Total coal) - **IMPLEMENTED**

Note: IEA_COALPW is now computed from constituent datasets rather than requiring separate collector/cleaner.
