How are proxy measures determined, and how rigorously are their approximations to the target variable evaluated? With the case of beef consumption in India being more likely indicative of a cultural norm than a policy success, how can we better isolate policy effects or at least better understand confounding variables?
How do we account for countries that are more administratively divided (i.e. into states or provinces) than others? Essentially, is there a way the SSPI considers potentially diverging federal, state/province, and municipal policies? 
The discussion of “Who is in charge” in Section II p.3 makes me think of the point that all economies exist within relation to one another; that the prosperity of one may come at the direct loss of another. I wonder if this would be an interesting comparative perspective to take on: to present exports, lack of homegrown industry, etc. of one country in direct relation to another, potentially shedding light on colonial history (Belgium economic interests in the DRC, skilled medical practitioners emigrating from Sierra Leone to Britain).
