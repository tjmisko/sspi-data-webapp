### Measuring Policy and Proxying 
- How are proxy measures determined, and how rigorously are their approximations to the target variable evaluated? For example, with the case of beef consumption in India being more likely indicative of a cultural norm than a policy success, how can we better isolate policy effects or at least better understand confounding variables?

### Federalism
How do we account for countries that are more administratively divided (i.e. into states or provinces) than others? Essentially, is there a way the SSPI considers potentially diverging federal, state/province, and municipal policies? 


## Extensions
### Extraction, Zero-Sum Economics, and the Legacies of Colonialism
The discussion of “Who is in charge” (Section II, p.3) makes the power relationships within countries especially salient. We might zoom out ask about the power relationships *among* economies: how do power relationships among countries affect the policies each country can pursue?
- Neoliberal economics imagines positive sum transactions among agents free to refuse or engage, but we know that countries exert power over other countries all the time. Under these conditions, the prosperity of one country may come at the direct loss of another. Perhaps we could call this the dark side of interdependence. 
- I wonder if this would be an interesting comparative perspective to take on: to present exports, lack of homegrown industry, etc. of one country in direct relation to another, potentially shedding light on colonial history (Belgium's economic interests in the DRC, skilled medical practitioners emigrating from Sierra Leone to Britain).
- In the SSPI, is it possible to model the effect of one country's policies on another with respect to the power relations among them? How might we quantify or model those power relations? Perhaps by modeling the countries as a network, with links across former colonies?

### History and Culture
- The SSPI is *ahistorical*: it does not consider the particular histories of each country, the cultures that emerged over that long history, and the historical memory that informs the political constraints on policy in those countries. What would reintroducing some of those considerations look like in the context of particular countries in the SSPI? Might we be able to explain some policy challenges (low score in the SSPI) on the basis of historical and/or culture factors? How would these considerations change the SSPI?
