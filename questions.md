## Interpreting Policy Scores
- What are we actually measuring when we talk about policy strength or weakness? What is the difference, if any, in interpreting the data as data and interpreting the data as policy?

## Number of Policies
- How do we think about the number of policies available to countries to affect a given outcome?

## Specific Questions
- How do we measure policies to regulate the production of waste? What policies are available to countries? How successful have particular countries been in implementing these policies? Can we measure these policies at the national level?
- How do we decide on goalposts for a given indicator? What research do we bring to bear to decide on goalposts? How does setting upper and lower goalposts differ methodologically?
