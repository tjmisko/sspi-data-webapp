- How do we understand and integrate the particular histories of each region? How should we track the historical background and institutional structure of the countries and areas we are analyzing? How will these histories shape our analytical perspective and our conclusions?
- How could we assess and capture the distributional dimensions of policy? Who has access to a particular policy? Who carries the administrative burden? Is accessing that policy a source of social stigma? Are there other barriers to access on the basis of race, class, gender, disability status, and/or sex?
- How do we evaluate the reliability of a data source source? How do we ensure that the underlying survey questions and statistical reports are as unbiased as possible? How might we improve our evaluations of reliablity?
- How are we measuring that a certain policy is the actual cause of the change and it is not influenced by other policies being passed later on or influenced by other countries? How do we think about the interaction among policies in the SSPI?
