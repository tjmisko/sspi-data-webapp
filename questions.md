    This file synthesizes questions from URAP students raised after first reading the working paper. 
purpose: >
    Students should refer back to the questions here throughout their research to remind themselves about the big picture questions about the SSPI.

## Universality of Policy
- The paper talked about how there are ideal policy benchmarks that are set, but is there a universal, international benchmark given that policy landscape varies so much by country?

## Accounting for Country Size
- How are we standardizing our findings across sizes of countries? Small country like Singapore or Luxembourg may have a different set of policies available to them than large countries like 
- Countries may be large or small in geographic terms (land area) and in population terms (population size). How do we account for these differences? Does population size and/or geographic area predict SSPI scores? What (if anything) does that tell us about the relationship between country size and policy?

## Federalism and Supranational Organizations
- Are we lumping countries that operate on a federal level together as one entity?
- How do we account for state by state variation in policies within a given country? For example, what about policies like minimum wage which vary across states in the US?
- Additionally, how do we account for the effect of supranational bodies like the European Union? The EU can set policies across many countries simultaneously through regulations promulgated from Brussels. Can we see the effect of this in important EU policies that affect many European countries simultaneously, but not countries outside the European Union?
