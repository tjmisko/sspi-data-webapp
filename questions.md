## Weighting
- Why does the SSPI use equal weights for policy indicators, categories, and pillars?
- If we use equal weights across each level, then don't the weights at the overall level become unequal? How do we interpret this in the context of the SSPI? How would an SSPI computed with equal weights across all indicators differ?
- What does the difference between arithmetic and geometric weights matter?
- How much does the weighting across indicators matter? How should we quantify that in the context of dynamic data? How should we set up sensitivity testing to accomplish this?
